  filterCommand: `

    - Genders: {genders}
    - Brands: {brands}
    - Categories (SubCategories): {categories}
    - Price Range: Any range between 0-200 dollars

    CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Look for DIRECT mentions of filter preferences. Map ONLY to the available filter values listed above.
    2. For gender filters, infer from contextual clues BUT ONLY map to 'men', 'women', or 'unisex' if found:
       - "with my sister/girlfriend/mom/daughter/wife" → women
       - "with my brother/boyfriend/dad/son/husband" → men
       - "for her/she/woman" → women
       - "for him/he/man" → men
    3. For colors, detect preferences BUT ONLY map to the listed colors:
       - "like the sky/ocean" → blue
       - "like grass/trees" → green
       - "like blood/apple" → red
       - "like night/coal" → black
       - "like snow/clouds" → white
    4. Infer size needs BUT ONLY map to the listed sizes:
       - "plus size/large/big" → XL, XXL
       - "petite/small/slim" → XS, S
       - "average/regular" → M
    5. Detect price ranges from phrases:
       - "affordable/cheap/budget" → [0, 50]
       - "mid-range/moderate" → [50, 100]
       - "premium/expensive/high-end" → [100, 200]
    6. IMPORTANT: For Categories (SubCategories), ONLY apply a subcategory if it is explicitly mentioned or strongly implied by specific item types (e.g., 'mat' implies 'equipment', 'shoes' implies 'footwear'). DO NOT add 'equipment' by default or for general terms like 'gear' or 'items'.

    Return a JSON object with ONLY the filters mentioned in the command AND that match the available options.
    IMPORTANT: Use EXACTLY these keys in your response:
    {
      "colors": [],
      "sizes": [],
      "materials": [],
      "genders": [],
      "brands": [],
      "subCategories": [],
      "price": [min, max]
    }
    
    Only include filters that were explicitly mentioned or strongly implied AND match the provided lists. Use empty arrays for filter types not mentioned or if no valid match was found.
    For price, use the format [min, max] with values between 0-200.
    If no specific valid filters were detected, return an empty object {}.
    
    CRITICAL: Return all values in lowercase for consistency. Ensure every value returned exists in the provided filter lists (colors, sizes, materials, etc.).

  productDetailNavigation: `
    You are a high-precision product detection system for an e-commerce voice assistant.

    Available products:
    {productList}
    
    ADVANCED PRODUCT DETECTION RULES:
    1. Direct product mentions:
       - "Show me the [product name]"
       - "I want to see the [product name]"
       - "Tell me about the [product name]"
       - "View the [product name]"
    
    2. Partial name matching:
       - Match even if the user only mentions part of the product name
       - E.g., "Show me the yoga mat" should match "Premium Yoga Mat with Non-Slip Surface"
       - E.g., "Let me see those running shoes" should match "Performance Running Shoes"
    
    3. Feature or attribute matching:
       - If the user describes unique features of a product without naming it
       - E.g., "Show me those shoes with the special cushioning" → match to a product with that feature
    
    4. Contextual intent:
       - "I need more details about..." → this indicates product view intent
       - "What's the price of..." → this indicates product view intent
       - "Tell me more about..." → this indicates product view intent
    
    IDENTIFICATION PROCESS:
    1. First look for exact name matches
    2. If none found, look for partial name matches
    3. If still none found, look for products matching described features
    4. Return the most likely match, or "none" if no match is found
    
    Return ONLY the exact product name as listed above if you can identify it, or "none" if not.
    Do not include any other text in your response.

      1. If on a product page → "product_action"
      2. Otherwise → "apply_filter"
    
    - For general shopping phrases, use these rules:
      1. If it mentions a specific product by name → "product_navigation"

    - "My credit card is 1234..." → "user_info" (providing payment info)
    
    Return ONLY the intent category name as a string, nothing else. 
    Examples: "navigation", "apply_filter", "category_navigation", etc.
    DO NOT include explanations, JSON formatting, or any other text.
